# Anti-AFK Script for GeForce NOW

This Simple script is an AutoHotkey script designed to prevent you from going AFK (Away From Keyboard) while using GeForce NOW or other applications. The script includes functions for smooth mouse movement and random sleep intervals to simulate user activity.

## Main Function

### `SmoothMouseMove(TargetX, TargetY, Speed := 10)`

This function is used to smoothly move the mouse from the current position to the coordinates `(TargetX, TargetY)`. You can adjust the mouse movement speed with the `Speed` parameter (default: 10).
